20210224 Orders Report Documentation

**Purpose**

The purpose of this report is to provide details about each purchase order. It includes options to filter results by date ordered, subscription date range, order type, tags, and workflow status. The data are aggregated by purchase order line number, purchase order type, purchase order description, acquisition unit name, acquisition method, and material type (physical or electronic). Acquisition unit name, subscription dates, and tags are optional, so data will be available for these fields only if the institution has elected to enter it. For subscription dates, the &quot;subscription\_to&quot; date parameter is not the last day of the interval; it is the day after (half open interval). This ensures including all times up to midnight in the date range.

**Parameters**

The parameters in the table below can be set in the WITH clause to filter the report output.
